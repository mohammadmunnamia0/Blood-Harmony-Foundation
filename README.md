## 🔐 Why These Restrictions?

> **Why ask someone to register as a donor to request blood?**

Because **security and authenticity** are critical. Without verification, the platform could be misused with fake or careless requests — potentially delaying help to those truly in need.

By requiring donor registration and validation:
- We **discourage spam**
- Ensure **real, traceable users**
- Build **community trust**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned features to make the platform more inclusive and convenient:

- 🔹 **Allow Blood Requests Without Donor Registration**
    - But still require:
        - 🆔 Verified National ID
        - 📍 Address
        - 📞 Phone Number
        - 📋 Reason for Request

This approach aims to **balance ease of access with platform integrity**.
