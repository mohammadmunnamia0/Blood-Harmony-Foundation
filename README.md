## 🔒 Why These Restrictions?

Without verification, the platform could be misused by spam or fake requests.  
By requiring donor registration for sensitive actions (like requesting blood or viewing donor info), we ensure real, traceable activity that helps those truly in need.

---

## 🔮 Planned Enhancements

- ✅ Allow blood requests without registration, with additional identity verification:
  - 🆔 NID number  
  - 📍 Address  
  - 📞 Phone number  
  - 📋 Reason for blood request
